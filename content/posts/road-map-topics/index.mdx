# My road map topics to learn and be a good front-end web developer

`Hello World`, I am Kerem Aydemir and I am senior student at METU PETE. I decided to be a web developer after I completed my internship at Petroleum Industry. The internship was between two semesters. When I went back to my home I needed to make a decision which job to do. After a long and stressful thought process, I decided to be a programmer. But I didn't know what type of programmer should I be. I was making small fun games with Unity earlier and it was fun, however, after some searching and trying some web programming, I decided to be a **Front-end Developer**. From the beginning of my last semester, I started exploring the web technologies and try to understand the basic concepts. Recently, I watched a YouTube video, [Dan Abramov SLAYS Frontend Interview w/ Ex-Twitch Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqII0AOW1NM&t=1443s) and heard that Dan Abramov has a blog website, I always wanted to write a blog about my developer journey, so I checked it out and it was almost what I wanted. Then I found the original repository [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), and made some simple changes to make a version of myself.

**In this blog, I have collected the topics and made a road map for myself.**.

**My goal is to learn Front-end and find a job after 50 weeks of learning. I will start my journey at August 1st. I will post a blog every end of the week. I will be doing this in order to:**

- Stay motivated
- Summarize my study and revise
- Show my desire and passion
- Help to beginners like me

_My next post will show the planned 50 week schedule_

_Now, Let's see the topics (I may update the topics later)_
