Make many projects and also try to do your own versions of old ones.

### 1st Medium Project:

---

### Objective: Make an item creator

**There are 3 types of item:** weapon, armor and jewelry

**Items have levels and base damage ranges** depending on level

**Items with a certain level has a base name**, for example: **level 1** sword: **wooden sword** (base damage: 1-10), **level 90** sword: **dragon slayer** sword (base damage: 90-120)

**Items may contain two kinds of affixes:** suffix and prefix, this affixes contain power-ups 

**Affixes have tiers up to tier7**: if tier increase, their power increase  
Every affix has it's own range for power:  
for example:    
suffix a: tier1(1-3) tier2(4-6) tier3 (7-11) tier4(12-17) tier5(18-24) tier6(25-33) tier7(34-45)  
suffix b: tier1(2-3) tier2(4-5) tier3 (6-7) tier4(8-10) tier5(11-14) tier6(15-19) tier7(20-25)  

**Items have a color** and items with each colors have different restrictions for affixes:

- White item: at most 1 affix (prefix or suffix), maximum affix tier: tier5
- Blue item: at most 2 affix, maximum affix tier: tier5
- Yellow item: at least 3 affix, at most 4 affix (2 prefix & 1 suffix, 1 prefix & 2 suffix or 2 prefix & 2 suffix), maximum affix tier: tier5
- Purple item: at least 1 affix, at most 4 affix, at least 1 affix with tier6 or tier7, maximum affix tier: tier7
- Orange item: exactly 5 affix, maximum affix tier: tier2

**Items have quality:**

Quality has no upper limitation and it increase the affixes' power, for example:  
**quality:1** will increase **2%** of the each affix on the item  
**quality:10** will increase **20%** of the each affix on the item

*example: item with 2 suffixes and quality:10*

Suffix1: increase maximum health (tier5): 10% (9%-12%) + 20% --> 12%

Suffix2: increase armor (tier3): 5% (3%-5%) + 20% --> 6%

**Items have stability:**

Stability can be used in order to either upgrade the item quality or affix tier, maximum stability: 70, initial stability of orange items are always 70

Stability range of items: (30-70)

When upgrade is done: (1-20) stability is spent

Item stability cannot go below 0, if item stability is 1 and upgrade is done, item stability will be 0 and no upgrades can be done anymore

Affixes with tier5, tier6 or tier7 cannot be upgraded further.


#### How it is gonna work in web

- There will be 6 buttons on top to create items: random, white, blue, yellow, purple, orange
- When buttons are clicked a new item will be generated and replaced with old item.
- Item can be upgraded with buttons next to affixes or quality


#### Future of this project

- Make a Full stack React version
- Add user login with Google authentication
- Upgrade the logic further (maybe idle mmorpg??)
- Make an inventory
- Make trades with other people


#### Algorithm

Sets and maps

#### CSS
